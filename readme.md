#### What is an Idiom?

The best definition in software development might be a *miniature design pattern*. It is generally
considered to be positive, and it's somewhat synonymous with *elegant*. This library may
not be the most obviously elegant solution for the problem domains it addresses, but it does support
some elegant practices. Immutability is elegant and virtuous in functional programming, and the
entire library can be used in immutable code. Redundancy is never elegant, and the *regexfactory*
module makes it possible to reduce redundancies in regular expressions.
